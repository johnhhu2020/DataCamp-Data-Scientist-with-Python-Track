    "As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models, and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In this course, you'll learn the many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this course, you'll learn how to import data from a large variety of import data sources, for example: (1) flat files such as .txt and .csv;  (2) files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheet, Stata, SAS and MATLAB files;  (3) relational databases such as SQLite & MySQL, PostgreSQL.  We'll cover all of these topics in this course.  \n",

    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "First of, we're going to learn how to import basic text files, which we can broadly classify into types of files - those containing plain text, such as the opening of Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and those containing records, that is, table data, such as titanic.csv, in which each row is s unique passenger onboard and each column is a characteristic or feature, such as sex, carbin and survived or not.  The latter is know as a flat file and we'll come back to these in a minute.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll figure out how to read lines from a plain text file: Lets do it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "To check out any plain text file, you can use Python's basic \"open()\" function to open a connection to the file.  To do so, you assign the filename to a variable as a string, pass the filename to the function \"open()\" and also pass it the argument \"mode='r'\", which makes sure that we can only read it (we wouldn'twant to accidentally write to it), assign the text form the file to a variable \"text\" by applying the method \".read()\" to the connection to the file.  After you do this, make sure that you close the connection to the file using the command \"file.close()\".  \n",
    "# Its always best practice to clean while cooking!  \n",
    "You can then print the file to console and check  it out using the command \"print(text)\".  A brief side note: if you wanted to open a file in order to write to it, you would pass it the argument \"mode='w'\".  We won't use that in this course as this is course on Importing Data but it is good to know.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "You can avoid having to \"file.close()\" the conncetionn to the file by using a with statement.  This allows you to create a context in which you can execute commands with the file open.  Once out of this clouse/context, the file is no longer open and, for this reason, with is called a Context Manager.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What you are doing here is called \"binding\" a variable in the context manager construct; while still within this construct, the variable file will be bound to \"open(filename, 'r')\".  It is best practice to use the with statement as you never have to concern yourself with closing the file again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following interactive coding sessions, you'll figure out how to print file content to console.  You'll also learn to print specific lines, which can be very useful for large files.  Then we'll be back to discuss flat files and then I'll show you how to use Python package NumPy to make our job of importing flat files & numerical data a far easier beast to tame.  \n",
