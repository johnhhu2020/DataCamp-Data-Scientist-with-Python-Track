    "It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames."

There you'll learnall about list comprehensions, which allow you to wrangle data in lists to create other lists, a tool to utilized by all Data Scientist working in Python today.  You'll also learn about iterators, which you have already seen in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it, iterators are everywhere in PythonLand, and to put it simply, allow you to rapidly iterate DataScience protocols and procedures over sets of objects.  These are a couple of cool functionalities in Pythonland you'll encounter in the sequel to this course, which will conclude with an entire chapter devoted to a case study in which you'll apply time and time again techniques learnt in both od these courses.  \n",

The output expression should be the product of the first and second element in each tuple in pops_list. Because the 2nd element is a percentage, you also need to either multiply the result by 0.01 or divide it by 100. In addition, note that the column 'Total Urban Population' should only be able to take on integer values. To ensure this, make sure you cast the output expression to an integer with int().\n",
    "    Create a scatter plot where the x-axis are values from the 'Year' column and the y-axis are values from the 'Total Urban Population' column.\n"

    "\n",
    "This is the last leg. You've learned a lot about processing a large dataset in chunks. In this last exercise, you will put all the code for processing the data into a single function so that you can reuse the code without having to rewrite the same things all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to define the function plot_pop() which takes two arguments: the filename of the file to be processed, and the country code of the rows you want to process in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all of the previous code you've written in the previous exercises will be housed in plot_pop(), calling the function already does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Loading of the file chunk by chunk,\n",
    "    Creating the new column of urban population values, and\n",
    "    Plotting the urban population data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a lot of work, but the function now makes it convenient to repeat the same process for whatever file and country code you want to process and visualize!\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to use the data from 'ind_pop_data.csv', available in your current directory. The packages pandas and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as pd and plt respectively for your use.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you are done, take a moment to look at the plots and reflect on the new skills you have acquired. The journey doesn't end here! If you have enjoyed working with this data, you can continue exploring it using the pre-processed version available on Kaggle.\n",
