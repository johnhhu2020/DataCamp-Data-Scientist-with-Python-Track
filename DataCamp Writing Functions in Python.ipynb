    "You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!"

    "The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.\n",

    "DRY also known as dont repeat yourself, and the do one thing are good ways to ensure that your functions are well designed and easy to test.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are writing code to look for answers to research a question, it is totally normal to copy and paste a bit of code , tweak it slightly, and rerun it.  However, this ind of repeated code can lead to real problems.  When you undating the path and variable or somethings, it is easy to accidentally introduce errors that are hard to spot.  Another problem with repeated code is that if you want to change something, you often have to do it in multiple places.  Repeated code is a good sign that you should write a function.  \n",

The code will also be easier for other developers to understand, and it will be more pleasant to test and debug.

When we set the variable a equal to the list [1, 2, 3], the Python interpreter set the list [1, 2, 3] in a location in computer memory, and variable a is piointing to that location.  Then if we type b = a the Python set b pointing to whatever a is pointing to.  So is we append 4 to the end of a, both variables get it cause there is only one list.  Likewise, if we append 5 to b, both variables get it.  \n",

Then you and your friends dance, eat, and have a good time.  When the party is done, the caterers clearn up the food and remove the tables.  In this analogy, the caterers are like context manager.  \n",

    "In this example, we read the text of the file, store the contents of the file in the variable data, and store the length of the contents in the variable length.  When the code inside the indented block is done, the open() function makes sure that the file is closed before continuing on in the script.

Statements in Python that have an indented block after thenm like if/else statements, function definition etc. are called compound statements.  The with statement is another type of compound statement.  Any code that you want to run inside the context that the context manager created needs to be indented.  When the indented block is done, the context manager gets a chance to clean up anything that it needs to, like when the open() context manager closed the file.  \n",

    "**Like most decorators, we'll start off by defining a wrapper() function.  This is the function that the decorator will return.  The wrapper() function takes any number of positional and keyword arguments so that it can be used to decorate any function.  The first thing the new function will do is record the time that it was called with the time() function.  Then wrapper() function gets the result of calling the decorated function, and we dont return that value yet though.  After calling the decorated function, wrapper() checks the time again, and prints a message about how long it took to run the decorated function.  Once we've done that, we need to return the result that the decorated function returned before.  \n",

We want pass n as an argument, instead of hard-coding it in the decorator - for i in range(3), but for i in range(n).  If we had some way to pass n into the decorator, we would decorate print_sum() so that it get run 3 times and decorate print_hello() 5 times.  \n",

We start ur new decorator with a nested wrapper() function as usual.  Now since we are still inside the run_n_times()function, we have the access to the n parameter that was passed to run_n_times() function.  We can use that to control hom many times we repeat the loop that calls our decorated function.  As usual for any decorator, we return the new wrapper function, and if run_n_times() returns the decorator() function we just defined, then we can use that return value as a decorator.  \n",

You've decided that in order to ensure your code is doing exactly what you want it to do, you will explicitly check the return types in all of your functions and make sure they're returning what you expect. To do that, you are going to create a decorator that checks if the return type of the decorated function is correct.\n",

    "**You've covered a lot in this course.  In the first chapter, you learned how to make high-quality functions by giving them docstrings and by making sure that they only Do One Thing.  Remember the DRY, Dont Repeat Yourself, helped you notice when you need to pull part of your code into a resuable function.  You also learned how Python passes arguments to functions, and difference between mutable and immutable variables.  In the chapter on context managers, you learned how to use the keyword with to enter and then exit a context.  You also learned how to write your own text managers by using the @contextlib.contextmanager() decorator.  You also spend a lot of time in this course understanding decorators: how thay work, how to use them, and how to write decorators of your own.  Finally in chapter 4, you learned how to use @functools.wraps(func) to make sure your decorated function maintains their metadata.  And you learned hwo to write decorators that take arguments.  \n",
