    "**The Pandas package is a powerful tool for manipulating and transforming a in Python.  However, when working on an analysis, the data needed could be in multiple tables.  This course will focus on the vital skill of merging tables together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# As we start, two quick clarifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, through other courses on DataCamp, you may have learned how to import tabular data as DataFrame.  In this course, you may hear the words table and DataFrame, but they are equivalent here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we will refer to combingning different tables together as merging tales, but note that some refer to this same process as joining.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us learn about merging tables, we will use data from the city of Chicago data portal.  The city of Chicago is divided into fifty local neighborhoods called wards.  We have a table with data about the local goverment offices in each ward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we want to merge the local government data with census data about the population of each ward.  If we look at the wards table, we have information about the local goverment of each ward, such as the goverment office address.  The census table contains the population of each ward in 2000 and 2010, and that change as percentage.  Additionally, it includes the address for the center of each ward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "The two tables are related by their ward column.  We can merge them together, matching the ward number from each row of the ward table to the ward number from the census table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Pandas package has an excellent DataFrame method for performing this type of merge called .merge() method.  The .merge() method takes the first DF and merges it with the second DF.  We use on= argument to tell it we want to merge the 2 DFs on the ward column.  Since we listed the ward table first, its columns will appear first in the output, followed by the columns from the second census table.  By default, it returns the rows have matching values for the on=column in both tables.  This is called an inner join.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An inner join will only return rows that have matching values in both tables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**You may have noticed that the merged table has columns with suffixes of underscore x or y.  This is because both wards and census tables contained address and zip columns.  To avoid multiple columns with the same name, they are automatically given a suffix by the merge method.  We can use the suffix= argument of the .merge() to control this behavior.  We provide a tuple where all of the overlapping columns in the left table are given the suffix '_ward', and those of the right table will be given the suffix '_cen'.  This makes it easier for us to tell the difference between the columns.   \n",

Notice that ward 1 and its alderman Joe is repeated in the resulting table because the licenses table has many businesses in the 1st ward.  The Pandas takes care of the one-to-many relationship for us and doesnt require anything on our end.  We can use the same syntax as we did with one-to-one relationship.  By printing the shape, we can see our original tablehas 50 rows, while after merging with the licenses table, the resulting table has 1000 rows.  When you merge tables that have a one-to-many relationship, the number of rows returned will likely be different than the number in the left table.  \n",

In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, called biz_owners, to the licenses table.

    "**In our last lesson, we learned how to merge two tables with a one-to-many relationship using the .merge() method.  Merging data like this is a necessary skill to bring together data from different sources to answer some more complex data questions.  Sometimes we need to merge together more than just two tables to complete our analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we used two tables form the city of Chicago.  One table contained business licenses issued by the city, the other table listed info about the local neighborhoods called wards, including the local goverment official's office.  Now we also have a table of businesses that have received small business grant money from Chicago.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# The grants are funded by taxpayers money.  Therefore, it would be helpful to analyze how much grant money each business received and in what ward that business is located.  We then could determine if one ward's business received a disproportionately large anount of grant money.  \n",

    "Our code sample prints the first few rows and some columns of the merged table.  The output of the merge duplicates Reggie's Bar for each matching zip in the grats table, which is not what we want.  If instead, we merge on address only, there is a small risk that the address would repeat in different parts of the city.  Therefore, the best option is to merge the tables using the combination of both address and zip code.  (???????????????)\n",

As before, the matching rows between the two DFs are returned with the columns from the grants table table listed first.  However, when we merge on two columns, in this case address and zip code, we are requiring that both the address and zip code of a row in the left table match the address and zip code of a row in the right table in order for them tobe linked to each other in the merge.  \n",
