    "\n",
    "How do we get from data to answers? Exploratory data analysis is a process for exploring datasets, answering questions, and visualizing results. This course presents the tools you need to clean and validate data, to visualize distributions and relationships between variables, and to use regression models to predict and explain. You'll explore data related to demographics and health, including the National Survey of Family Growth and the General Social Survey. But the methods you learn apply to all areas of science, engineering, and business. You'll use Pandas, a powerful library for working with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy, StatsModels for regression, and Matplotlib for visualization. With these tools and skills, you will be prepared to work with real data, make discoveries, and present compelling results."

    "Welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python.  The instructor's name is Allen Downey.  [The goal of exploratory data analysis is to answer the questions and guide decision making].  As a first example, we'll start with a simple __question: what is the average birth weight of babies in teh United States?__  To answera question like this, we have to find an appropriate dataset or run an experiment to collect it.  Then we have to get the data into our development environment and prepare it for analysis, which involves cleaning and validation.  For this questionwe'll use data from the National Survery of Family Growth, which is available from the National Center for Health Statistics.  The 2012-2015 dataset includes information about a representative sample of women in the USA and their children.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python module we'll use to read and analyze data in Pandas.  Pandas can read data in most common formats, including CSV, Excel, and the format NSFG data is in, HDF5 (DO you recall how we test importing data from different sources with Pandas? get remember it ).  The result from \"pd.read_hdf('nsfg.hdf5', 'nsfg')\" is a DataFrame, which is the primary data structure Pandas uses to store data.  Using \"df.head()\" giving us pregnancy for each of women who participated in the survey, and one column for each variable.  The DF has an attribute \".shape\", which is the number of rows and columns.  And the \".columns\" attributes, as an [index] (DF are formed by 3 object, index, columns, data, do you recall when we learned this topic, go back to read it again).  Thats another Pandas data structure, similar to a list; in this case its a list of variables names, which are strings.  For the reliable information about the data, you have to read teh documentation.  Say what does this columns \"birthwgt_lb1\" means?  The documentation tell us that it is the weight in pounds of teh first baby from this pregnancy, for cases of live birth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, a DF is like a Python's dictionary, where the variable names are the keys and the columns are the values.  You can select a column from a DF using the bracket operator, with a string as the key.  The result is a Series, which is another Pandas data structure.  In this case the Series contains the birth weights, in pounds, of the live births (or in the case of multiple births, the first baby).  The \"df.head()\" shows the first 5 rows of the Seris and the name of the Series, and the datatype; float64 means that these values are 64-bit floating point numbers.  Notice that one of the values is NaN, which stands for \"Not a Number\".  NaN is a special value that can indicate invalid or missing data.  In that example, the pregnancy did not end in live birth, so birth weight is inapplicable.  \n",

    "In the previous lesson, we read data from the National Survery of Family Growth and selected a column from a DataFrame.  [In this lesson, we'll check for errors and prepare the data for analysis].  We'll use the same DF we used in the previous lesson - nsfg, which contains one row for each pregnancy  in the survey.  We'll select the variable \"birthwgt_lb1\", which contains the pound part of birth weight, and assign it to pounds.  And \"birthwgt_oz1\" contains the ounce part of birth weight, so we'll assign that to ounces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Before we do anything with this data, we have to validate it].  One part of validation is confirming that we are interpreting the data correctly.  We can use the \"df.value_counts()\" method to see what values appear in pounds and how many times each value appears.  By default, the results are sorted with the most frequent value first, so we use \".sort_index()\" method to sort them by value instead (?? You mean use \"df.sort_values()\" method), with the lightest babies first and heaviest babies last.  As we'd expect, the most frequent values are 6-8 pounds, but there are some very light babies, a few very heavy babies, and two values, 98 and 99, that indicate missing data.  We can validate the results by comparing them to the codebook, which lists the values and their frequencies.  The results here agree with the codebook (__He means the data range is okay with documentation, go back the chack data processing with Pandas course or data cleaning course I guess and re-study it__), so we have some confidence that we are reading and interpreting the data correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to validate the data in with \"df.describe()\" method, which computes summary statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, and max (__But be careful with data type and range, as value based categories will appear min, max, mean statistic summary__).  Here we have the results for pounds.  The \"count\" is the number of values, The \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" values are 0 and 99 (Here the 98 and 99 are actually not real values, but specific category labels to represent value missing or bad things), and the 50th percentile, which is the [median] (Why based on statistic knowledge, sometime we don't use avg but use median instead?   {__Why median is used instead of average?__\n",
    "The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it uses all values in the data set to give you an average. For data from skewed distributions, the median is better than the mean because it isn't influenced by extremely large values.}   [][Google this topic], and I think one of the course talked about this topic), is 7.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is about 8.05, but that doesn't mean much because it includes the special values 98 and 99.  Before we can really compute the mean, we have to replace those values with NaN to represent missing data.  The \"df.replace()\" method does what we want; it takes a list of values we want to replace and the values we want to replace them with.  The \"np.nan\" means we are getting the special value NaN form the NumPy library.  __The result from the \"df.replace()\" method is a new Series, whcih we assign back to replace its origin__.  Remember that the mean of the original Series was about 8.05 pounds.  The mean of the new Series is about 6.7 pounds.  It makes a big difference when you remove a few 98 and 99 pounds values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Instead of making a new Series, you can call \"df.replace(inplace=True)\" with \"replace=True\", which modifies the existing Series in place, that is without making a copy].  Here's what that look like for ounces.  Since we didn't make a new Series, we don't have to assign it back to its origin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now say we want to combine pounds and ounces into a single Series that contains total birth weight.  Arithmetic operators work with Series objects; so to convert from ounces to pounds, we can divide by 16 (there are 16 ounces in a pound).  Then we can add the two Series objects to get the total (Compare the calculation difference between SQL and Pandas, and recall in which course we learned such topic, re-study it and [][Google this topic]).  And here are the results.  The refreshed more accurate values are mean 7.1 pounds, which is little more than what we got before we added in the ounces part.  [Now we are close to answering our original question, the average birth weight for babiesin the USA] (__See, we need to check its distribution, cause the median will be more representive than mean in the skewed distribution__[][Google charm]).

    "Let's get back to the motivating question for this chapter: what is the average birth weight for the babies in the USA.  In the previous lesson, we used data from teh NSFG to compute birth weight in pounds (we convered the ounces part and added it back to modified new pound column) and we stored the result in a Series.  [Lets see what the distribution of those values looks like].  We'll use the pyplot submodule from the Matplotlib visualization library which we import as plt.  The Pyplot provides \"plt.hist()\" function, which takes a Series and plots a histogram; that is, it shows the values and how often they appear.  However, __[pyplot doesn't work with NaNs]__ (How does Tableau deal with NaNs, does that NaNs will effect our calculation?  [Googe this]), so we have to use \"df.dropna()\", which makes a new Series that contains ony the valid values.  The bins tells \"plt.hist()\" function to divide the range of weights into 30 intervals, called \"bins\", and count how many values fall in each bin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"plt.hist()\" function takes other arguments that specify the type and appearance of the histogram; you will have a chance to explore these options in the next exercise.  To label the axes we'll use the \"plt.xlabel()\" and \"plt.ylabel()\", and finally to display teh plot, we use \"plt.show()\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Checking below plots, the x-axis is birth weight in pounds divided into 30 bins.  While the y-axis is the number of births in each bin.  [__The distribution looks a little like a bell curve, but the tail is longer on the left than on the right; that is, there are more light weight babies than heavy babies__].  That makes sense because the distribution includes some babies that were born preterm.  The most common duration of pregnancy is 39 weeks, which is \"full term\", \"preterm\" is usually defined to be less than 37 weeks.  [Google it yourself].  To check which babies are preterm, we can use the \"prglngth\" column, which records pregnancy length in weeks.  When you compare a Series to a value, the result is a Boolean Series.  If you compute the mean, you get the fraction of Trues; in this case, its close to 0.4, that is about 40% of the births in this dataset are preterm (What happened?  Why there is so much portion of poor babies born earlier).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a Boolean Series as a filter; that is, we can select only rows that satisfy a condition or meet some [][criterion].  For example, we can use preterm and the bracket operator to select values from birth_weight, so preterm_weight contains birth weights for preterm babies.  To select the full-term babies, we can use the tilde (~) operator, which is logical NOT or inverse; it makes the True False diverse.  Not surprisingly, full-term babies are heaver, on average, than preterm babies.  (__but the weight distribution of two baby groups are different, the full-terms are XXX adn teh preterms are YYY, does these tells us any valuable information__)  If you have 2 Boolean Series, you can use logical operators to combine them; ampersand (&) is the logical AND, and the vertical bar (|) or pipe is logical OR.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[There is one more thing we have to do before we can answer our question; resampling].  The NSFG is not exactly representative of the USA population; be design, some groups are more likely to appear in the sample than others; they are [__\"oversampled\"__].  __Oversampling helps to ensure that you have enough people in every subgroup to get teh reliable statistics, but it makes tha analytics a little more complicated__.  However, [__we can correct for oversampling by resampling__].  (How can we identify if there is oversampling happened? and does oversampling is always a bad thing, any cirteria? ab testing, retention calication? [][Google this topic, *****])  We won't get into the details here, but the institor have provided a function [\"resample_rows_weighted()\"] that we can use for the exercise.  If you are interested in learning more about resampling, check out DataCamp's statistics courses.  \n",

    "As we saw in a previous exercise, the NSFG dataset includes a variable 'agecon' that records age at conception for each pregnancy. Here, you're going to plot a histogram of this variable. You'll use the bins parameter that you saw in the video, and also a new parameter - histtype - which you can read more about here in the matplotlib documentation. Learning how to read documentation is an essential skill. If you want to learn more about matplotlib, you can check out DataCamp's Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib course.\n",

    "In the previous chapter, we used histograms to visualize distributions.  In this chpater, we'll represent 2 more ways to represent distributions and we'll learn when to use each of them.  And we'll work with a new datase.  The General Social Survey, or GSS, has run annually since 1972, it surverys a __representative sample,__[Define representative][Google this topic][https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=probability+maff+function+and+distribution+difference]) of the adult population in the USA, and asks questions about demographics and beliefs about social and political issues.  It is widely used by politicians, policy makers, and researchers, including the instructor.  The GSS contains hundreds of variables; we've selected just a few.  And the instructor have already clearned and validated them, so we just have to read the file.  \"gss = pd.read_hdf('gss.hdf5', 'gss')\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with this dataset, lets look at the distribution of educ, whcih records the number of years of education for each respondent.  First we'll select a column from the DF. And we've already seen one way to visualize distribution, a histogram.  Based on the histogram, we can see the general shape of the distribution and teh central tendency - it looks like the peakis near 12 years of education.  [__But a histogram is not the best way to visualize this distribution__] [How and When can you know that???].  An [alternative is a probability mass function] [Google this topic, and learn statistics, what is a Probability Mass Function, and how it was used in statistics? ] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function] [Give me a break here, focus on statistics afterwards], or PMF, that contains the unique values in the dataset and how often each one appears.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The instructor had provided a class called Pmf that computes a probability mass function.  This function is based on a Pandas Series (__Class inheritance, Recall what we learned in Python OOP I suppose, we learned how to write a self modified Panda DataFrame class, with a new timestamp sttribute logging DF creating time__[Re-study it] [And image what would be the class institor wrote, as I saw the bins equal to 1, and round the years column, and that would be my approach, if I'm doing it]) and it provides some methods that aren't in Pandas.  The first argument can be any kind of sequence; in this case, its a Series object.  The second argument indicates that we don't want to normalize this PMF.  I'll explain what that means soon.  The result is a Series that contains the values on the left and the counts on the right.  In this dataset, there are 566 [respondents] who report that they have zero years of formal eduction.  You can use the bracket operator to look up a value in a Pmf and get a count.  The example shows that there are 47689 respondents with 12 years of education, which is the most frequent value.  [__Usually when we make a Pmf, we want to know the fraction of respondents with each value, rather than the counts__].  We can do that by  setting normalize=True, then we get a normalized Pmf, that is a Pmf where the frequencies add up to 1.  Now if we use the bracket operator, the result is a fraction.  In this example, the fraction of people with 12 years of education is 0.306.  The Pmf class provides a \".bar()\" method that plots a PMF as a bar art.  In the slide figure, we can see more clearly that the most common value is 12 years, but there are also peaks at 14 and 16, which correspond to 2 and 4 years of college.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this data, teh PMF is probably a better hoice than the histogram [WHY saying so? ].  [][__The PMF shows all unique values, so we can see exactly where the peaks are__] (So its like we did on Tableau, but not filtering column as DAY,  Think here, should we do this on our Tableau charts? Need to figure when to use each, a histogram or a PMF).  [][And because the histogram puts values into bins, it obscures some details].  In our example we can't see the peaks at 14and 16 years.  While [__PMF have limitations too__] as we'll see in the next lesson.  \n",
