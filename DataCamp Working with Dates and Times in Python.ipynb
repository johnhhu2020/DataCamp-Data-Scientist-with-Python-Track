    "You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You'll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you'll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion."

In chapter 3, we'll tackle one of the toughest parts of working with time: time zones and Daylight Saving.  And finally, in chapter 4, we'll connect what we've learned about working with dates and times to explore how Pandas can make answering even complex questions about dates much easier.  \n",

In this lesson, we're going to discuss creating dates and extracting some basic information out of them.  \n",

    "So why do we need a special date class?  To understand how dates work, in this chapter you're going to exlore 67 years of Hurricane landfalls in the US state of Florida.  The \"two_hurricanes\" is a list with dates of two hurricanes represented as string: the last 2016 hurricane (on October 7th, 2016) and the first 2017 hurricane (on June 21st, 2017).  The dates are represented in the US style, with the month, then day, then the year.  \n",

    "Suppose you want to do something interesting with these dates.  How would you figure out how many days had elapsed between them?  How would you check that they were ordered from earliest to latest?  How would you know which day of the week each was?  Doing these things manually would be challenging, but Python makes all of them easy.  By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to do each of these things yourself.  \n",

The inputs to \"date()\" function are the year, month, and day.  The first date is October 7, 2016 and the second date is June 21, 2017.  The order is easy to remember: it goes from the biggest to smallest.  year, month, day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this chapter, you'll create dates directly from list of strings, but in this lesson, youre stick to creating dates by hand or using list of already created dates.  You can access indivdual components of a date using the date-object's attributes.  You can access the year of the date using the \".year\" attribute, like so, and the result is 2016.  \n",

    "**In the last lesson, we discussed how to create date objects and access their attributes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to do math with dates: counting days between events, moving forward or backward by a number of days, putting them in order and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a step back, Think back when you first learned arithmetic.  You probably started with something like a line of numbers.  A number line tells you what order the numbers go in, and how far apart numbers are from each other.  Lets pick two numbers, 14 and 16, and represent them in Python as teh variable a and b respectively.  We'll put them into a list - l.  Pyhthon can tell us which number in this list is the least, using the \".min()\" function.  We can also subtract numbers.  When we subtrack two numbers, in this case subtracting 11 from 14, the result is 3.  Said another way, if we took 3 steps from 11, we would get 14.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Now lets think about how this applies to dates.  \n",
    "Lets call the line as calendar line, instead of a number line.  Each dot on this calendar line corresponds to a particular day.  Lets put two dates onto this calendar line: November 5th, 2017 and December 4th, 2017.  Let represents this in Python.  We start by importing the date class from datetime package.  We create two date objects: d1 is November 5th, 2017nd d2 is December 4th, 2017.  As before, we put them into a list, l.  What Python is doing under the hood, so to speak, is not that different from putting the dates onto a calendar line.  For example, if we call \".min()\" of l, we again get the \"least\" date, which means the earliest one.  In this case, thats November 5th, 2017.  \n",
    "And just like numbers, we can subtract two dates.  When we do this, we get an object of type \"timedelta\".  Timedeltas gives us the elapsed time between events.  If you access the \".days\" attribute of this object, you can obtain the number of days between the two dates.  We can also use a timedelta in the other direction.  First, lets import \"timedelta\" from datetime package.  Next, we create a 29-days timedelta, by passing \"days=29\" to \"timedelta()\" function.  Now when we add \"n_datetime\" to our original date we get back new date.  Python handled the fact that November has 30 days in it for us, without us having to remember which months are 30 day months, 31 day months, or 28 day months.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally a quick side note: we will use the \"plus-equal\" operation a number of times in the rest of this course, so we should discuss it.  If you arent familiar with it, you can see how it works here.  Just Google it.  Google knows everything.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about how date objects are very similar to numbers, and how you can subtract them to get a timedelta object, or add timedelta to a date object to get a new date.  We also briefly touched on the += operator. Its time for you to practice these concepts.  \n",

    "## Turning dates into strings\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python has a very flexible set of tools for turning dates back into strings to be easily read.  \n",
    "# We want to put dates back into strings when, for example, we want o print resualts, but also if we want to put dates into a filename, or if we want to write dates out to CSV or Excel files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets create a date and see how Python prints it by default.  As before, we need to import date from datetime package, and lets again create a datetime object of November 5th, 2017 using \"date(2017, 11, 5)\" function.  And when we ask Python to print the date object ( ?????? ), it prints the year, the month and the day, separated by dashes, and always with 2 digits for the day and month.  We cansee this is probably a YYYY-MM-DD representing date information.  This is the default format which is also know as IOS format, or ISO 8601 format, after the international ISO 8601 that is based on.  The ISO 8601 strings are always the same length since month and day are written with 0s when they are less than 10.  We'll talk about another dvantage of ISO 8601 in a moment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the ISO representation of a date as a string, say to write it to a CSV file instead of just printing in, you can call the \"isoformat()\" method.  We can put the outcome inside a list or other containers so that you can see that it creates a string.  The ISO 8601 format has another nice advantage.  To demonstrate, we've created a variable called some_dates and represented 2 dates here as strings, January 1, 2000, and December 31, 1999.  The dates formatted as ISO 8601 strings sort correctly.  When we print the \"sorted()\" version of this list, the earlier day is first and teh later date is second.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we use the ISO 8601 dates in file names, they can correctly sorted from earliest to latest.  If we had used month or day first, the strings would not sort in chronological order.  If you don't want to put dates in IOS 8601 format, Python has a flexible set of options for representing dates in other ways, using the \".strftime()\" method.  The \"strftime()\" method works by letting you pass a \"format string\" which Python uses to format your date.  Lets see an example.  ( also can you recall when we learned this skills?  in data science toolbox courses or ? )\n",
    "\n",
    "We again create an example date of January 5th, 2017.  \n",
    "# (so we created a datetime object or just that date? and why sometimes Python print a memory location reference of a object, and other times Python print out the contained data?)\n",
    "We than call \".strftime()\" method on d, with the format string of \"%Y\", the \"strftime()\" reads the %Y and fills in the year in this string for us.  Also the \"strftime()\" metgod is very flexible: we can give it arbitrary strings with %Y in them for the format string, and it will stick the year in.  Pretty interesting.  For example we can use the format string of \"Year is %Y\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \".strftime()\" metod has other placeholders besides %Y: %m gives the month, and %d gives the day of the month.  Using these we can represent dates in arbitrary formats for whatever our needs are.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we discussed how Python can represent a date as a string.  We emphasized the importance and utility of ISO 8601 format, but also introduced the \".strftime()\" method, which let you turn dates into a wide variety of strings depending on your needs.  \n",

    "**In this chapter, you are going to move from only working with dates to working with both dates and times: the calendar day and time on the clock within that day.  As always, lets start with an example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Here is an example of a date and a time together: October 1, 2017, at 3:23:25 PM.  \n",
    "Unlike before, where we were only working with the date, we're now going to also include the time.  Lets see how to represent this in Python.  The first thing we have to do is import the datetime from the datetime package.  Yes, \"from datetime import datetime\".  Ideally, these would have different names, but unfortunately for historical reasons they have the same name.  This is just something to get used to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to create a datetime called \"dt\" and populate the fields together.  The first 3 arguments to the datetime class are exactly the same as the date class.  Year, then month, then day, each as a number.  Next, we fill in the hour, computers generallyuse 24 hour time, meaning that 3 PM is represented as hour 15 of 24.  We then put in the minutes, 23 out of 60.  And finally, the seconds.  The \"October 1, 2017 at 3:23:25 PM\" is represented as a datetime in Python as \"datetime(2017, 11, 1, 15, 23, 25)\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these arguments need to be whole numbers; if you want to represent 0.5 seconds, you can add microseconds to your datetime after the second arg.  Below we added 500,000 microseconds, or 0.5 seconds.  That is Python breaks seconds down into millionths of a second for you when you need that kind of precision.  If you need billionths of a second precision (which happens sometimes in science and finance) We'll cover nanoseconds when we get to Pandas at the end of this course.  Python defaults to 0 microseconds if you dont include it.  Thats a lot of arguments; if it helps, you can always be more explicit and use named arguments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make new datetime from existing one by using the \".replace()\" method.  For example, we can take datetime we just made, and make a new one which has the same date, but is rounded down to the start of the hour.  We call \"dt.replace(minutes=0, second=0, microsecond=0)\", this creates a new datetime with the same values in all the other fields, but those ones we changed with \".replace()\" method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we wrap up, lets talk about the data we will use for the rest of this course.  You will be working with data from Capital Bikeshare, the oldest municipal shared bike program in the US.  Throughout the Washington DC area, you will find these special bike docks where riders can pay to take a bike, ride it, and return to this or any other station in the network.  We will be following one bike, ID number \"W20529\", on all the trips it took in October, November, and December of 2017.  Each trip consisted of a date and time when a bike was undocked from a station, then times passed, and the date and time when \"W20529\" was docked again.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In this video, we walked through how to create datetime objects in Python.  You're going to practice that in the exercises, and also work with the Capital Bikeshare data and see how we can use Python to understand the trips that \"W20529\" took throughout the 3 months that we're interested in.  \n",

    "\n",
    "# **Much like dates, datetimes can be printed in many ways.  Python also has another trick: you can take a string and turn it directly into a datetime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with printing dates and then move on to asking Python to parse them.  First lets create a datetime again.  As what we did before, creteing the variable dt corresponding to December 30, 2017 at 15:19:13, the end of the last trip that W20529 takes in our dataset.  Just like date objects, we use the \".strftime()\" method to create a string with a particular format.  First. we'll just print out the year, month and day, using the same format codes we used for dates.  %Y stands for the 4 digits year, %m for the month, and %d for the day of the month.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can add in the hours, minutes and seconds.  Again, we print the year, month and day, and now we add 3 more format codes: %H gives us the hour, %M gives us the minutes, and %S gives us the second.  There are also format codes for 12-hour clocks, and for printing the correct AM or PM.  As before, we can make these formatting strings as complicated as we need.  Here is another version of the previous string.  Finally we can use the \".isoformat()\" method, just like dates, to get a standard-compliant way of writing down a datetime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The officially correctly way of writing a datetime is the year, month, day then a capital T, then the time in 24 hour time, followed by the minute and second.  When is doubt, this is a good format to use.  We can also parse dates from trings, using the same format codes we used for printing.  You'll use this often when getting date and time data from the internet, since dates and timesare often represented as atrings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# \"datetime.strptime()\" function\n",
    "We start as before, by importing the datetime class.  The method we're going to use is called \"datetime.strftime()\" function, which is a short for string parse time.  The \"datetime.strptime()\" function takes 2 arguments: the first argument is the string to turn into a datetime, and the second argument is the format strin that says how to do so.  First we pass the string we want to parse.  In this case, a string representing December 30, 2017, at 15:19:13.  Then we pass the format string which, as mentioned before uses the same format code we used for the \".strftime()\" method. In this case, first the month, then the day, then the year, all separated by slashes, then a space, and then the hour, minutes, and seconds separated by colons.  You usually need to figure this out once per dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look and see what kind of object we've made, by printing the type of dt, we see that we've got a datetime.  And \n",
    "# if we print that datetime, we get a string representation of the datetime.  (str representation of obj or location)\n",
    "We can see that the parsing worked correctly.  We need an exact match to do string conversion.  For example, if we leave out how to parse the time, Python will throw an error.  And similarly, if there is  errant comma or other symbols, \"datetime.strptime()\" function will not perfor as expected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these is another kind of datetime you will sometimes encounter: the Unix timestamp.  Many computers store datetime information behind the scense as the number of the seconds since January 1, 1970.  This date is largely considered the birth of modern-style computers.  To read a Unix timestamp use the \"datetime.fromtimestamp()\" method.  Python will read your timestamp and return a datetime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've just covered how to use format codes to turn datetime into strings and strings into datetimes, and what ISO 8601 format looks like with time involved.  Now you're practice moving back and forth between strings and datetimes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Much like dates, datetimes have a kind of arthmetic; we can compare them, subtract them, and add intervals to them.  Because we are working with both days and times, the logic for durations is a little more complicated, but not by much.  Lets have a look.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with dates, to get a sense for what's going on we put our datetimes on a timeline.  These 2 datetimes here correspond to the start and end of one ride in our data set.  To follow along in Python, we'll load these 2 as variable start and end.  When we subtract datetimes, we get a timedelta.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A timedelta represents what is called a duration: the elapsed time between events.  When we call the \".total_seconds()\" method of this timedelta object, we get back the number of seconds that our timedelta represents.  In this case 1450 seconds elapsed between our start and end.  1450 seconds is 24 minutes and 10 seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a timedelta by hands.  You need to from datetime import timedelta.  To create a timedelta, you specify the amount of time which has elapsed.  For example, we make delta1, a timedelta which corresponds to a one second duration.  Now when we add delta1 to start, we see that we get back a datetime which is one second later.  We can create another timedelta, delta2, whcih is 1 day and 2 hours and 3 minutes in duration.  Now when we add it to start, we get a new datetime which is the next day and 2 hours and 3 minutes later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Timedelta can be created with any number of weeks, days, minutes, hours, seconds or microseconds, and can be as small as a microsecond or as large as 2.7 million years.  Timedeltas can also be negative, for example if we create delta3, whose argument is -1 weeks, and we add it to start we get a datetime corresponding to 1 week earlier.  We can also subtract a positive and get the same result.  We create delta4 which corresponding to a 1 week duration, and we subtract it from start.  As you can imagine, we get the same answer as when we added a negative timedelta.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we showed how to create timedeltas, which represent a duration of time.  You can create timedeltas by subtracting 2 datetimes, which tells you how much time has elapsed between events.  You can also create a timedelta directly, then add and subtract timedeltas from datetime to make new datetimes.  In the next few exercises, you'll see how these pieces can be combined together to answer more complex questions.  \n",

    "**Sometimes, you really need to know exactly when something happened.  Up untill now, the datetime objects you have worked with are what is called \"naive\", and cant be compared across different parts of the world.  They don't know anything about their time zone.  What does this matter?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before time zones, each city or town set its clock so that noon was directly overhead.  Another city 100 miles away would also set their clocks to be noon when the sun was overhead.  But this means that 2 cities had clocks that were different, by maybe 15 or 20 minutes.  When people moved by foot or horseback, this wasn't a problem.  Then railroads, and later telegraphs, came into existance.  Now you could move or communicate with someone 100 or 1000 miles away fast enough that time had to be consistent.  Govements solved this problem by declaring that all clock within a wide area would agree on the hour, even if some were ahead or behind of their solar time.  The US for example, has 4 major time zones, plus 1 for Alaska and another for Hawaii.  Our bike data was collected in Washington  DC, which observes Eastern time.  But since we're not using the sun anymore, how do we know how to set the clock?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the UK was the first to standardize its time, everyone in the world aets their clocks relative to the original historcal UK standard.  This standard is called UTC.  Because all clocks are set relative to UTC, we can compare time around the world.  Generally clock west of UK are set earlier tha UTC, and clocks east of the UK are set later than UTC.  For example, the eastern US in typically UTC minus 5 hours, while India is typically UTC plus 5 hours 30 minutes.  Lets see this in code.  \n",

    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "As before, you import datetime and timedelta, now you also import timezone.  This will let you specify what timezone the clock was in when our data was recorded.  We create a timezone object, which accepts a timedelta that explains how to translate your datetime into UTC.  In this case, since the clock that measured our bicycle dateset was 5 hours behind UTC, we create ET to be at UTC-5.  We can specify what time zone the clock was in when the last ride started in our dataset.  The clock that recorded the ride was 5 hours behind UTC.  Now if you print it, your datetime includes the UTC offset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Making a datetime aware of its timezone means you can ask Python new questions.  For example, suppose you want to know what the date and time would have been if the clock had been set to India Standard Time instead.  First create a new timezone object set to be UTP+5 hours and 30 minutes.  Now use \n",
    "# the \".astimezone()\" method to ask Python to create a new datetime object corresponding to the same moment, but adjusted to a different time zone.  \n",
    "In this case, because the clocks in India would have been set 10.5 hours ahead of clocks on the eastern US, the last ride would have taken place on December 31, at 1 hour 39 minutes, and 3 seconds past midnight local time.  Same moment different clock.  \n",

The clock stays the same, but the UTC offset has shifted.  Or just like before, you can all the \".astimezone()\" method.  Now if we adjust into UTC with \".astimezone()\", we change both the UTC offset and clock itself.  \n",

    "**Now that you understand how UTC offsets work, its time to talk about how you use timezones in practice.  Imagine a world map of different timezones in the earth, as of 2017.  They cut across countries, and within countries, and sometimes one is even totally surrounded by another one.  How could you possibly know all of these when you need to align your data to UTC?  DO you need to look up the offset for each one in some big spreadsheet somewhere?  Cant computer help with this?  Thankfully yes.  \n",

    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "There is a database called \"tz\", updated 3-4 times a year as timezone ruleshange.  This database is used by computer programs across many programming langurages.  Because timezone information changes o quickly, it doesn't ake sense to bundle it directly into Python.  Instead, you will use a package called \"dateutil\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start by making a timezone object that corresponds to eastern US, where our bicycle data comes from.  Within \"tz\", time zones are defined first by the continent they are on, and then by the nearest major city.  For example, the time zone used on the eastern seaboard of the US is \"America/New York\".  We fetch this timezone by calling \"tz.gettz()\", and passing \"America/New York\" as the string input.  Other example includes: \"America/Mexico City\", \"Europe/London\", \"Africa/Accra\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let look at our last ride again.  Instead of specifying the UTC offset yourself, you pass the timezone you got from tz.  Look at the result, and you can see that its got the right UTC offset.  Even more excitingly, this same object will adjust the UTC offset depending on the date and time.  If we call datetime() with the time information of our first ride, and pass in the same time zone info, we see that it gives us a different UTC offset.  We will discuss daylight saving time in the next lesson, but suffice to say that in some places the clock change twice a year.  Instead of having to look up when these things change, we just ask the time zone database to know for us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tz\" includes rules for UTC offsets going all the way back to the late 1960s, and sometimes earlier.  If you have data stretching over a long period of time, and you really care about getting the exacthours and minutes correct, you can use tz to put all of your date and timestamps on to a common scale.  \n",

    "**Some places change their clocks twice a year to create a longer summer evenings.  This ractice is called daylight saving time, but it would be better called daylight shifting time.

In the next lesson, we'll discuss handing the opposite case, when the clocks move back in the fall.  Lets look at an example.  On March 12, 2017, in Washington DC, the clock jumped straight from 1:59 AM to 3:00 AM, the clock springs forward.  It never officially struck 2:00 AM anywhere on the East Coast of the US that day.

    "Lets see the same thing in code.  To be as clear as possible, lets create the UTC offset by hand for now instead of using \"tz.gettz()\" class of \"dateutil\" package.  We start by creating a datetime object - spring_ahead_159am, for March 12th, at 1:59:59, without any timezone information.   We print the results out with \".isoformat()\" method to check that we have the time right, and we make another object for spring_ahead_3am.  We subtract the 2 datetime objects and ask how much time has elapsed by calling \".total_seconds()\" method.  As expected, they are an hour an done second apart.  \n",

    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "As before, to fix problems with comparing a datetime we start by creating timezone objects.  We define Eastern Standard Time (EST) using the \"timezone(timedelta(hours=-5))\" constructor.  We set the offset to -5 hours.  Similarly we define Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) with an offset of -4 hours.  We assign our first timestamp, at 1:59:59 AM to be in EST.  When we call \".isoformat()\", we see it has the correct offset.  We assign our second timestamp, at 3:00 AM, to be in EDT, and again check the output with \".sioformat()\" method.  When we subtract the 2 datetime objects, we see correctly that 1 second has elapsed.  Putting things in terms of UTC once again allowed us to make proper comparisons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we know whne the cutoff is without looking it up ourselves.  The \"dateutil\" to the rescue again.  Just like before when it saved us from having to define timezones by hand, dateutil saves us from having to know daylight saving rules.  We create a timezone object by calling tz.gettz() and pass our timezone description string.  Recall that since Washington DC is in \"America/New York\" time zone, so thats what we use.  Once again we create a datetime corresponding to 1:59 AM on the day that east coast of the US springs forward.  This time though, we set the \"ztinfo=\" arg to eastern time.  Similarly, we create a datetime set of 3 AM on March 12th, and when we set \"tzinfo=\" to be eastern time, dateutil figures out for us that it should be in EDT.  \n",

    "# **In this chapter, you will use the Pandas library to work with dates and times.  \n",
    "You should have encountered Pandas before, but now we will add datetimes to the mix.  To start with, we read csv file into Pandas Data Frame through pd.read_csv() func.  Each of these rows has a start date, an end date, a start station and en station, the bike number and wheather the ride was from someone who is a member or who walked up to the kiosk and bought a ride on the spot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [] to select specific column, and we can also get the particular column with \".iloc[]\" method.  Because we didn't tell Python to treat the start date and end date columns as datetimes, they are simply strings or objects.  We want them to be datetimes so we can work with themeffectively, using the tools from the first 3 chapters of this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "If we want Pandas to treat these columns as datetimes, we can make use of the argument \"parse_dates=\" of the \"pd.read_csv()\" function, and set it to be a list of column names passed as strings.  Now Pandas will read these columns and convert them for us to datetimes.  Pandas will try and be intelligent and figure out the format of your datetime strings.  In the rare case that this doesn't work, you can use the \".to_datetime()\" method that lets you specify the format manually.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we ask again for the start date for row 2, we get back a Pandas Timestamp, which for essentially all purpose you can imagine its a Python Datetime object with a different name.  They behave basically exactly the same.  Since our start date and end date columns are now datetimes, we can deal with them the way we usually deal with datetimes.  For example, we can create a new column - duration, by subtracting start date from end date.  We get a timedelta object column.   \n",
