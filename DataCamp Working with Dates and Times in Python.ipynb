    "You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You'll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you'll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion."

To start off this course, you'll learn how to work with date objects in Python, starting with the dates of every hurricane to hit Florida since 1950. You'll learn how Python handles dates, common date operations, and the right way to format dates to avoid confusion.\n",

In chapter 3, we'll tackle one of the toughest parts of working with time: time zones and Daylight Saving.  And finally, in chapter 4, we'll connect what we've learned about working with dates and times to explore how Pandas can make answering even complex questions about dates much easier.  \n",

In this lesson, we're going to discuss creating dates and extracting some basic information out of them.  \n",

    "So why do we need a special date class?  To understand how dates work, in this chapter you're going to exlore 67 years of Hurricane landfalls in the US state of Florida.  The \"two_hurricanes\" is a list with dates of two hurricanes represented as string: the last 2016 hurricane (on October 7th, 2016) and the first 2017 hurricane (on June 21st, 2017).  The dates are represented in the US style, with the month, then day, then the year.  \n",

    "Suppose you want to do something interesting with these dates.  How would you figure out how many days had elapsed between them?  How would you check that they were ordered from earliest to latest?  How would you know which day of the week each was?  Doing these things manually would be challenging, but Python makes all of them easy.  By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to do each of these things yourself.  \n",

The inputs to \"date()\" function are the year, month, and day.  The first date is October 7, 2016 and the second date is June 21, 2017.  The order is easy to remember: it goes from the biggest to smallest.  year, month, day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this chapter, you'll create dates directly from list of strings, but in this lesson, youre stick to creating dates by hand or using list of already created dates.  You can access indivdual components of a date using the date-object's attributes.  You can access the year of the date using the \".year\" attribute, like so, and the result is 2016.  \n",

    "**In the last lesson, we discussed how to create date objects and access their attributes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to do math with dates: counting days between events, moving forward or backward by a number of days, putting them in order and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a step back, Think back when you first learned arithmetic.  You probably started with something like a line of numbers.  A number line tells you what order the numbers go in, and how far apart numbers are from each other.  Lets pick two numbers, 14 and 16, and represent them in Python as teh variable a and b respectively.  We'll put them into a list - l.  Pyhthon can tell us which number in this list is the least, using the \".min()\" function.  We can also subtract numbers.  When we subtrack two numbers, in this case subtracting 11 from 14, the result is 3.  Said another way, if we took 3 steps from 11, we would get 14.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Now lets think about how this applies to dates.  \n",
    "Lets call the line as calendar line, instead of a number line.  Each dot on this calendar line corresponds to a particular day.  Lets put two dates onto this calendar line: November 5th, 2017 and December 4th, 2017.  Let represents this in Python.  We start by importing the date class from datetime package.  We create two date objects: d1 is November 5th, 2017nd d2 is December 4th, 2017.  As before, we put them into a list, l.  What Python is doing under the hood, so to speak, is not that different from putting the dates onto a calendar line.  For example, if we call \".min()\" of l, we again get the \"least\" date, which means the earliest one.  In this case, thats November 5th, 2017.  \n",
    "And just like numbers, we can subtract two dates.  When we do this, we get an object of type \"timedelta\".  Timedeltas gives us the elapsed time between events.  If you access the \".days\" attribute of this object, you can obtain the number of days between the two dates.  We can also use a timedelta in the other direction.  First, lets import \"timedelta\" from datetime package.  Next, we create a 29-days timedelta, by passing \"days=29\" to \"timedelta()\" function.  Now when we add \"n_datetime\" to our original date we get back new date.  Python handled the fact that November has 30 days in it for us, without us having to remember which months are 30 day months, 31 day months, or 28 day months.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally a quick side note: we will use the \"plus-equal\" operation a number of times in the rest of this course, so we should discuss it.  If you arent familiar with it, you can see how it works here.  Just Google it.  Google knows everything.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about how date objects are very similar to numbers, and how you can subtract them to get a timedelta object, or add timedelta to a date object to get a new date.  We also briefly touched on the += operator. Its time for you to practice these concepts.  \n",
